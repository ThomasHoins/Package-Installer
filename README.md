The ServiceUI.exe is needed to run the powershell script in System Context and still be able to show a UI in User context. It has to be fetched from the SCCM Server ...\OSD\Packages\Microsoft_Deployment_Toolkit_Files_2013\Tools\x64.
And it has to be placed inside the Resources folder.

The ServiceUI.exe is not open source and is not part of this Project. So we will haave to leave it out of here.
